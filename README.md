## macos_usb
A script that automates creating a macOS installation media on Linux. Based on the work of @myspaghetti: https://github.com/myspaghetti/macos-guest-virtualbox  
This script installs only open-source software and unmodified Apple binaries, without closed-source additions or fishy ISO images
